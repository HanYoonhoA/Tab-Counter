# Tab Counter Extension

The Tab Counter Extension is a tool designed to provide insights into your browsing habits. With this extension, you can effortlessly monitor the number of tabs you have open and identify your most frequently visited websites.

## Features:

- **Tab Count Display:** Easily view the total number of tabs open in your browser.
- **Website Counts:** Receive a breakdown of the number of tabs open for each website.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific websites using the search feature.
- **Sorting Options:** Organize your website counts alphabetically or by tab count.
- **Theme Selection:** Personalize your browsing experience by choosing between light and dark themes.
- **Recent Tabs:** Access links to your most recently opened and closed tabs conveniently.

## Note:

This is my first attempt at coding something 'big'. Some of the features may have bugs, one bug you may encounter is the errors message, a message will pop up for new tabs because they don't have an assigned link. Additionally, there's an issue with the 'Most Recent Closed' feature it's currently not functioning properly.
